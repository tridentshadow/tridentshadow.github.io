							<h2>Death by Trident</h2>
							<p>On September 21st, 2025 at approximately 6:45 PM, Dr. Jonathan C. Hoefs, also known as Ishtaya to those who love him, was peacefully reading a book on his kindle at a packed café in Boulder, CO, while quietly drinking peppermint tea.
<br><br>

Nothing could have been further from his mind then what was about to happen.

<br><br>
An employee and a manager assumed a stake-out position around him, creating a buzz in the surrounding population of customers. The manager made a purposeful show of publicly humiliating Ishtaya and informing him that he needed to leave in front of all the people there. When asked why he was being asked to leave, no reason was given, and a request for someone to talk about it with him was flat out refused.

							<h2>In the dark</h2>
							<p>No incident had happened. Ishtaya was left completely in the dark as to what to do. Most of his time at the café had been spent on his computer, with occasional socializing, during his many visits. The incident came completely out of the blue, and shocked him, leaving him feeling singled out and discriminated against.
<br><br>

In subsequent email conversations, the café refused to discuss the matter with Ishtaya, or give any reason as to why he was asked to leave.


<br><br>
Even though the café was not forthcoming, a little bit of investigative research started to unravel the threads of this fabric of illusion. A group of women, influenced by a criminal ring that had followed and hounded Ishtaya for over 15 years, had manufactured consent in the café by manipulating management and customers with lies and false narratives to create the desired result. </p>

							<p><blockquote>    Indigo Moon: When did this all begin?
<br><br>
    Ishtaya: Reel the tape back to about 15 years ago, in Santa Cruz, California.
<br><br>
    I was dating a woman with borderline personality disorder. I was passionate about helping her believe in herself, about reflecting her inner beauty back to her, about convincing her that she wasn’t crazy.
<br><br>
    IM: Sounds like you were in love.
<br><br>
    I: Yes (laughs). I really believed I could do it.
<br><br>
    Over time, a darker shadow revealed itself. Public incidents of uncontrolled rage began to occur, including at an airport. She locked me in a closet once and the police had to be called. I could not leave without her getting so desperately paranoid that I was with another person that another incident occurred. I would be interrogated every time I returned.
<br><br>
    I had to literally drag myself out of that relationship. It’s one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I had to face every layer of enabling, people pleasing, and the desire to save someone that were preventing me from seeing how unhealthy the relationship was. And that it was never going to change.
<br><br>
    In an ideal world that would’ve been the end of it, but it wasn’t. I began to have friend groups and communities targeted by this individual, approached with slander designed to destroy trust and close doors. Over the years, these narratives were polished more and more to achieve this.
<br><br>
    I took the attitude that I should just let it go and trust the universe. That it would just go away.

							<p><blockquote>
							   I was driving to a hot springs on the West Coast about a year after that. I called the hot springs to get a reservation on the way. Had done that for years.
<br><br>
    They informed me that I was on the "do not admit list", and that I would not be able to make a reservation, which was news to me, and that they would send me a letter. I drove home and later received a letter, which informed me that they would not tell me why I had been kicked out of the hot spring, but that the only way for me to get back in was for me to write them a letter admitting guilt to what I had supposedly done. Just like the incident in Boulder, nothing had happened, and I was left completely in the dark with regards to what to do.
<br><br>
    Investigative research revealed that the hot springs had received a call allegedly from me, where the person on the line was going down on a woman and taunting the operator at the same time.
<br><br>
    IM: You’re serious.
<br><br>
    I: Yes. The operator could hear the whole thing. And they thought it was me.
<br><br>
    The hot spring had been my ex and I’s place.
<br><br>
    IM: Did it stop there?
<br><br>
    I: No. Over subsequent years, I continued to experience closed doors. Heartbreaking experiences where friends and communities fell away, and usually without talking to me. They strategically designed the narratives so people wouldn’t talk to me about it.
<br><br>
    Stories like ‘he got kicked out of the hot spring’ were self-manifested, and used to support their agenda. Just like what happened in Boulder.
<br><br>
    You don’t know what it’s like to go into a community, and have people you don’t even know treat you horribly, as if justified. Never even giving you a chance. It's followed me to several communities since then.
<br><br>
    IM: Like Boulder?
   <br><br> 
    I: Yes.

    IM: Ok, let's go back to the incident in Boulder. Take us back to that day.
<br><br>
    I: I was drinking peppermint tea. Calmly enjoying my book. I hung out at the café a lot. Wasn’t expecting anything out of the ordinary to happen.
<br><br>
    IM: What was your feeling upon leaving that day?
<br><br>
    I: I was shocked. My nervous system was so disregulated. I felt violated, publicly shamed, and discriminated against.
<br><br>
    Up to that point, the café had represented a safe place for me to spend time in Boulder. All that was shattered.
<br><br>
    IM: Talk to us about your attempts to communicate with the café.
<br><br>
    I: I went out of my way to be the bigger person in my letters, to alert them to what was going on, give them the benefit of the doubt. Because I knew these people were using them. They were using them as a tool, as a weapon for their own agendas, and I wanted to get through to the café. I knew if I could get through to them, and get them to investigate the matter with an un-biased mind, we could have a community miracle. I live for that.
<br><br>
    IM: Did they do that?
<br><br>
    I: No. They never even investigated the matter. From the beginning I was treated as guilty "de facto", without even the opportunity to communicate or present what actually happened.
<br><br>
    IM: Sounds like the yakuza (laughs).
<br><br>
    I: I’m not sure I would choose that metaphor, but there is some truth in there.
<br><br>
    IM: So they allowed these people to use the publics’ trust in the café as a tool for their personal agendas, which were discriminatory.
<br><br>
    I: Exactly. After the incident, people began spreading the story that I had been kicked out of the café. They used this as fuel for the bullying and character assassination campaign they had already been engaging in, and losing, in the community. That was their plan all along, to regain the ground they had lost in the war they were waging, and they got what they wanted.
<br><br>
    IM: So they used the café.
<br><br>
    I: The café allowed itself to be used.

							<p><blockquote>    IM: Why are you being discriminated against?
<br><br>
    I: Discrimination often has to do with a specific class of people, but not always.
<br><br>
    It always has to do with individuals being marginalized. Sometimes it’s an African-American. Sometimes it’s a women. Sometimes it’s the kid with the knobbly knees. Sometimes it’s the kid who is too smart. The energy behind it is always bullying.
<br><br>
    IM: You mentioned that, after Santa Cruz, this happened in other communities? 
<br><br>
    I: Yes. Eventually I moved to Mt. Shasta, looking for a fresh start.
<br><br>
    For a short time, I experienced a safe and loving community, what I had always wanted. I was ecstatic.
<br><br>
    But then the bullying and the slander began again.
<br><br>
    IM: They followed you?
<br><br>
    I: Exactly. Eventually, the same things that had happened in Santa Cruz happened in Mt. Shasta. All the doors closed.
<br><br>
    And then Sedona. Maui. Taos. Crestone. Boulder.
<br><br>
    Each time, I reached deep down inside, choosing to believe that there was good in the world, so I had a reason to get up each morning, choosing to move forward in spite of what was happening around me.
<br><br>
    IM: And each time you got burned
<br><br>
    I: Yes.
<br><br>
    Over time, they were able to create the illusion of reinforcement of their narratives through group complicity, just like they did at the café, fashioning a network of bullies that would willingly participate. Individuals that fed off the same thrill of dominating and destroying a human being.
<br><br>
    IM: I imagine you’ve gone through dark times.
<br><br>
    I: I’ve been close to killing myself at least 20 times now.
<br><br>
    IM: Oh my God.
<br><br>
    (Long silence).
<br><br>
    I: Consciousness is a tool, either used for freedom or bondage. The same technologies of bondage used by power and control structures at the macro level are used at the micro level, at the local level, wearing different masks, for the agendas of ego. 
  <br><br>  
    IM: What has been the hardest part of all this?
   <br><br> 
    I: The hardest part has been that over time they have polished their narratives, and the ways that they are delivered to individuals and communities, to isolate me further in every area of my life.
<br><br>
    In the beginning, I had old friends who supported me staunchly and helped communities see through the lies that they were spreading. They learned over time that they had to the erode these relationships to get what they wanted.
<br><br>
    IM: To isolate you? 
<br><br>
    I: Yes.

							<p><blockquote>
							  So they started manufacturing self corroborating scenarios, like they did with the hot spring incident, and at the café, to erode trust in even my closest relationships.
<br><br>
    IM: Because they could go around saying "O did you hear he did this and this"?
<br><br>
    I: Yes, and once they got enough momentum, this person would call this other person whom they trusted, who had also been lied to...
<br><br>
    IM: And they manufactured consent. 
<br><br>
    I: Exactly. Group complicity and the illusion of truth.<br><br>
							
							IM: Go on.
<br><br>
    I: Overtime, they approached people involved in my living situations, professional relationships, and intimate relationships, and eroded those, too. Because they were getting away with it. I’ve had multiple chapters where everything in my life fell apart overnight, due to their strategic targeting.
<br><br>
    IM: I’m so sorry.
<br><br>
    I: During these moments, I needed emergency help with moving, etc., especially as I also deal with significant muskoskeletal challenges.
<br><br>
    IM: Well at least you can talk! There was a time when you couldn't do that...
<br><br>
    I: Definitely. And during these times I’ve had to reach out to people very strongly, explain that I need help, I'm in an emergency, I have muskoskeletal challenges, etc.
<br><br>
    The criminal ring noticed this and started injecting narratives that I was lying about my body issues, and that people would be enabling that if they helped me. And I started going through chapters where that help would not come about.
<br><br>
    IM: So they adapted overtime.
<br><br>
    I: Yes. They have had 15 years to polish their narratives, and gradually isolate me more and more.
<br><br>
    IM: You said that they approached professional contacts?
<br><br>
    I: Yes. Just two examples. I work as an animal communicator and healer right now.
<br><br>
    I generally meet clients in community. This summer I met a client at an outdoor music concert in Nederland. It was a perfect match: their animal was approaching the end of life, and the human was  motivated and excited to go deeper in the spiritual process of their connection with the animal. That's the client I generally help the most, the client motivated to go deeper in their internal process. 
<br><br>
    We left the conversation with excitement about working together, and the intention to follow up. Someone at the concert saw me talking to them, and approached them.
<br><br>
    IM: And sabotaged the relationship?
<br><br>
    I: Yes.
<br><br>
    IM: What’s the second example?
<br><br>

    I: An important professioal institute that I gave talks at and did work with. They approached them.
<br><br>
    IM: And destroyed those relationships?
<br><br>
    I: Yes. And important professional opportunities. 
    <br><br>
    Over time, they also noticed that when I lead public workshops, or art and music events, which are the two things I’ve devoted my life to most, community would build around me. So now, whenever I schedule something publicly, they ramp up their activity around it. 
<br><br>
    IM: To sabotage it? 
    <br><br>
    I: To prevent me from sharing my gifts before I die. 
<br><br>
    IM: Sounds like they just want to destroy you.
    <br><br>
    I: This is all just the tip of the iceberg.

							<!--<h2>Conclusion</h2>-->
							<p><blockquote>
							
							
   <br><br>
    IM: What can we do about all of this, as a commmunity?
<br><br>
    I: I’ll give you two answers. First, it’s completely an inside job. For all of us. I have seen so many communities proclaim that they have the answers, that they have created a safe community, and that they are going to create the "new world", and yet participate in and are susceptible to these same patterns, just like the café in Boulder. So part of the illusion that we need to destroy is that we are going to come up with a formula that will do it for us.
<br><br>
    That is a certain mode of consciousness that has been programmed into us. It is our own internal vigilance and sincerity as human beings that is required for us to realize what we want to see manifest in our communities. Our critical thinking. Our considerate and sincere concern and motivation. No structure or formula will do it for us. And in fact, this whole mode of consciousness which tells us a stucture or formula will do it for us is designed to put us asleep enough so that we never achieve escape velocity from said mode of consciousness.
<br><br>
    The second answer is that we need to become passionate about communication, social structures, and human psychology, to become the agents of change.
<br><br>
    All of us need to study and understand why things like this happen. Why a basically well intentioned institution like the café in Boulder easily gets played in people’s hands.
<br><br>
    What sociopathic personalities are. How they can control entire communities, to get what they want.
<br><br>
    Our world wants to dumb us down to these issues, and eliminate our critical thinking. Because a truly smart world is impossible to subjugate. I’m not talking about the limited intelligence they taught you about in school. You have a much deeper potential for intelligence than that.
<br><br>
    There is no formula. There is no one answer. You are the answer. It is up to you to become the answer.
<br><br>
    America is a culture of denial. Our denial of experiences like those that happened to me is what’s going to enable it to happen to you, your children, or someone else in the future. Conversations like these help to break that cycle.
    <br><br>
    And there's a third one I just thought of. In fact, this is probably the most important one of all. 
    <br><br>
    All of us need to take responsibility for our communities and not consent to this, we need to create a field of consciousness that does not consent to it. 
    <br><br>
    Over the years, there were so many people who tried to do the right thing, who tried to be good people, who this criminal ring were able to manipulate via false narratives, money, sex, peer pressure...
<br><br>
     IM: Peer pressure?
<br><br>
     I: Yes, often all it took was to convince someone that they would not be popular if they stood up to the bullies behavior.
<br><br>
     Sometimes people would fall back on the attitude that I needed to take care of this myself, that I needed to stand up to the bullies, which I tried to do in every way I could, you’ll notice that they strategically cut off every avenue, making sure that people wouldn’t talk to me, etc. so it really does take a village and a commitment from the community to change the environment that enabled this to happen. Or it will happen again. If not to me, than to someone else.
<br><br>
    IM: You have a doctoral degree, correct?
<br><br>
    I: Yes. I have a Doctorate of Musical Arts with a focus in music composition.
<br><br>
    IM: How does this relate to all this?
<br><br>
    I: Along the way, I learned how important communication is. And listening.
<br><br>
    How music reflects a level of communication that we’ve lost touch with.
<br><br>
    Over the years it has made me passionate about leading dialogue circles to transform communities, as well as the workshops on sound and consciousness that I created and lead all around the world.
<br><br>
    In the workshops, we experience the directness of sound, how sound bypasses the layers of front-loading that the world uses to control our consciousness, how it can be a transformative tool to bring us that much closer to Truth, and how to become immune to this front loading. They are very powerful and transformative. They integrate neurobiology, as well as somatic practices, in a dynamic environment. 
    <br><br>
    They began with a class I taught at UC Santa Cruz entitled "Sound, Listening, and Consciousness".
<br><br>
    IM: Not un-relevant to what you’ve had to go through, as that seems to be at the heart of how we form judgment. 
<br><br>
    I: Absolutely. It is at the heart of the neuro-perceptual process which forms judgment, and keeps us chained to the theater of the world and its' habits of judgment. Sound bypasses that. 
<br><br>
    Through the transformative process, we become liberated into the natural, infinite, organic potentiality that is our birthright, into the reality of the world which judgment obfuscates, or veils.
    <br><br>
    I’ve recently started a school of neuro-perceptual unlearning and vibrational re-sourcing that expands the listening work into whole new dimensions that serve at much deeper levels, that resources us to bring new patterns into the world.
<br><br>
    IM: Your story is amazing.
<br><br>
    I: Which part.
<br><br>
    IM: The accident.
<br><br>
    I: Ah yes. When I was 18 I was in a train accident.
<br><br>
    I couldn’t speak for five years and all my muscles atrophied. I was bed ridden. People took care of me full time. Bathing, feeding, etc.
<br><br>
    Eventually a healer came into my life who changed it. Through the power of my own self-will, using Qigong, nutrition, spiritual practices, and his support, I healed myself.
<br><br>
    IM: Wow. What was that experience like.
<br><br>
    I: People treated me like I wasn’t there. Because I couldn’t trigger the muscles in my face, people assumed I was a vegetable. But I was 100% conscious. I learned a lot about consciousness from that. People attribute consciousness and value to someone based on what they can perceive from the outside. It is perhaps our most fundamental hubris as a species.
<br><br>
    IM: You also work with clients one and one as an animal communicator and healer?
<br><br>
    I: Correct. I also teach students one on one as a composer and musician.
<br><br>
    Going back to the Boulder incident, do you have any further comment on that?
<br><br>
    Corporations do not care about their impact on communities and individuals. Community organizations do. Throughout, the café did not care at all about the duress they put me through, or the impact on the community around us.
<br><br>
    They put themselves out there as a community organization, but there is nothing behind it.
<br><br>
    They also put themselves out there as a Buddhist organization. There is no active practice or presence of Buddhism there. Nor compassion. The only presence of Buddhism is as a PR tool to get them more money from your pocket. This is blatant cultural appropriation.
<br><br>
    Finally, throughout, I was treated as guilty "de facto", without even the opportunity to have a voice, rather than innocent until proven guilty. The American government, which I’m not a huge fan of, treats people at least innocent until proven guilty.
<br><br>
    We can draw from this that the café is not even matching the American government in term of level of vibration and institutional integrity.
<br><br>
    IM: Will you ever go back?
<br><br>
    I: At this point, it would take a sincere apology and reconciliation process from them. I do not see that happening in the near future, but I will keep the door open.
<br><br>
    Divesting from corporate entities like this café, that are “cool” rather than ethical, will help to shift our world towards the latter, and I strongly encourage it.
<br><br>
    The strength and power inside of all of us does not enable us to dominate and bully others. That is not power.
<br><br>
    Rather it empowers us to become the beacons of kindness, insight, and effective action that the world needs. That is the path of true courage. And it is the true meaning of the metaphor of the Trident in Buddhism: right use of power, enlightened use of power.
<br><br>
    IM: So you've literally been in the shadow of the Trident.
<br><br>
    I: Exactly.
    <br><br>
    IM: You mentioned earlier that this is just the tip of the iceberg?
    <br><br>
    I: Yes.
    <br><br>
    IM: How much did we cover?
    <br><br>
    I: Maybe 5%.
<br><br>
    IM: Thank you. It has truly been an honor and a privilege.
<br><br>
    I: Thank you.

As Ishtaya leaves the room, I am struck by the gravity of his presence. It is as if a wind has come and gone. I feel that I have come in contact with one of the great spiritual presences of our age.
